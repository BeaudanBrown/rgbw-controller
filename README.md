This python script is used to enable the control of an RGBW light strip attached to a Raspberry Pi Zero using both a rotary encoder with a button and an http server.
There are 3 persistent colour presets which can be adjusted and cycled between, as well as dynamic effects which will explore a defined colour range based on a handful of variables.
